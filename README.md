## TMDB Movie Revenue Prediction Project
This project is part of the Data Science Bootcamp at the Erdos Institute. Our objective is to predict the revenue of movies by leveraging data sourced from TMDB (The Movie Database), inspired by a Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/tmdb-box-office-prediction/overview). This repository includes the code for data scraping and model training.
